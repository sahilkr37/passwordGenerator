# Password Generator

This is a simple password generator built with React. The project demonstrates the use of React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`) and is styled using Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- **Customizable Password Length:** Adjust the length of the generated password.
- **Character Options:** Include characters, numbers, and special characters in the password.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** Quickly copy the generated password with a single click.
- **Responsive Design:** Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive UI.

## Technologies Used

- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling the components.
- **React Hooks:**
  - `useState`: Manages the state of the password, length, and character options.
